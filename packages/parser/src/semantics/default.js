 * Parser package semantics.

 * Note: Evaluation semantics have been moved to @bassline/lang/src/semantics/default/
 * This file is kept for documentation/reference purposes only.
 *
 * The parser package focuses on parsing only - converting source code to AST.
 * Evaluation is handled by the lang package.

// This file is intentionally minimal - all evaluation logic has been migrated to @bassline/lang
