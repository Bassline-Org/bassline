; Test script for verifying remote peer UI polling
; This demonstrates what the UI should see when querying REMOTE_PEERS

; First, let's see what's in REMOTE_PEERS
print "Current remote peers:"
keys REMOTE_PEERS

; If you've connected to a peer, you can query it like this:
; peer: get REMOTE_PEERS "ws://localhost:8080"
; print peer

; To see the structure:
; print "URL:" get peer "url"
; print "Status:" get peer "status"
; print "Connected at:" get peer "connected-at"

; The UI polling does this:
; 1. Get all peer URLs: keys REMOTE_PEERS
; 2. For each URL, get the peer handle: get REMOTE_PEERS "url"
; 3. Extract status and connected-at from the peer handle
